        <p>Michigan Flora Website is home to thousands of plants but the website is very difficult to operate for non-tech savvy users. The website has a lot of secuirty issues and is not responsive. There are a lot of features in the website which need enhancement to cope up with today's world. The website is widely used which is why needs it needs migration to address all the requirements of the user and stakeholders.

        <hr>
        I was completely new to this website so I started by discovered all the exisiting resources. 
            <br>I performed the following activities to understand the website in a better way:
        <li>Interviewed Stakeholders and Users
            <li>Looked for competitive websites
              <li>Analyzed the code of the website
                <li>Understood the requirement of the clients by keeping close contact with them
                    <li>Visited the Michigan Herbarium to understand plants and what information is being displayed on the website

</li>
This detailed collection of information was really helpful in moving forward in the process of improving the website design.

        <h5><img src="img/marketing.png" width="30" height="30">  Analysis</h5>
        <hr>
      After collecting all the relevant information, I started analyzing to understand the key painpoints and areas of improvement. I came across the following findings based on my analysis:
         <li> Current asp.net version was too old leading to security issues
             <li> ASP.NET was restricting the design of the website as well as some features that the clients wanted
                 <li> Website wasn't responsive as it wasn't making use of bootstrap
          
                    <br>To understand better, I researched online and performed surveys to understand some of the best practices in market that addressed some of the problems that the website faced. I tried to find the major problems through the information I had collected in the discovery phase which needed to be given the most priority. With the use of technical skills, I tried to find the defects in the current code of the website. Based on this information I came across three migration paths that the website could follow making sure the security as well as the features requested.

        <h5><img src="img/idea.png" width="30" height="30">  Recommendation</h5>
        <hr>
      I weighed all the findings that I came across and prioritized it based on the client needs. 
I analyzed the different solutions that I had found before and tried to connect it with the findings
 I also took into consideration the important features that the clients wanted in the new website.
 <br> Based on all this information, I recommended to keep the website in ASP.NET. This recommendation solved the most important problem of security and made sure that the website would be migrated within 2 months which satisfied the time requirement. This solution also supported the features that the clients wanted and mainly supported Bootstrap that made the website responsive.
 I also created prototypes of the website with new features that would help the developer develop it and make the website user friendly.

        It was a great experience working on redesigning this website. The clients were so happy by my recommendations that they have decided to go ahead with my recommendation. Currently, the clients are hiring developers to implement the recommendation given by me and the entire migration would be completed in around 3 months. It was a great experience working with different stakeholders and making sure my recommendations matched up with everyone's expectations </p>
